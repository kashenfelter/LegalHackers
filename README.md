## "Computation, Law and the Net" Open Access Journal Special Issue
Dazza Greenwood is on the editorial board for an upcoming compilation of articles in a special issue open access journal titled: "Computation, Law and the Net".  Content in this issues is likely to be of interest to various individuals affilaited with Legal Hackers and perhaps some members of Legal Hackers will be interested to contribute an article.

## Blockchain-Backed Digital Signature Mock Trial

There will be a mock trial this fall at some point exploring practical admissibility and enforceability aspects of cryptographic digital signatures, attestations and "verified claims" executed with the public/private key pairs associated with a person's blockchain address and hence ensuring a digital signature on any electronic contract or other record can be publicly verifiable by reference to information accessible via a public blockchain to any person, any time.  We are doing a walk-through this Wednesday evening.

## Black Mirror Legal Discussion Group

We are convening a regular "Black Mirror Legal Discussion Group" to do screenings of cool episodes and facilitate discussion of the legal fact patterns and related conundrums raised by the scenarios postulated in each episode.  This is part of the general drive toward constituting "Computational Law" as a new area of research, development, scholarship and entrepreneurship at MIT and with some partners/
